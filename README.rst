Setting up
----------
These files must be placed under ``$HOME``/$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.

I consider them as my starter files, each machine might have a slightly
different config.

Files
-----
* ``screenrc``: GNU Screen key bindings and settings with a focus on quick navigation in nested scenarios
* ``vimrc``: Vim configuration with a text width of 100.
* ``bashrc``: Modern bashrc config file.  You'll need to use the associated profile file to source this.
* ``profile``: Sources the above bashrc file.

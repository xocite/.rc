Setting up
----------
These files must be placed under ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME``: ``~/.local/config``.

I consider them my starter files as each machine may have a local config.

I maintain my binaries in the ``~/binary`` directory.

Files
-----
* ``LICENSE``: The GNU General Public License v3.0 license.
* ``README.rst``: This file.
* ``aliases``: A list of common bash aliases sourced by ``~/.local/config/bash/bashrc``.
* ``bash_profile``: Environment config for local user bash sessions.  Sources the ``~/.profile`` file.
* ``bashrc``: Interactive non-login shell bash commands.
* ``editor``: A wrapper for the default editor.  Set to Vim.
* ``install.bash``: A small script to create symlinks based on this repo.
